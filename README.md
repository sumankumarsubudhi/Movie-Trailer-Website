# Details:
 The Movie Class in the media.py module creates a data structure to store your favorite movies, including movie title, box art URL (or poster URL) and a YouTube link to the movie trailer.

The entertainment_center.py file creates multiple instances of that Movie Class to represent your favorite movies and groups all the instances together in a list.

The Python module called fresh_tomatoes.py has a function called open_movies_page that takes in one argument, which is a list of movies and creates an HTML file which visualizes all of your favorite movies.

 - open the entertainment_center.py and run the module.
